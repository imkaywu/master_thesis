\chapter{Model of 3D Reconstruction}
\label{ch:3DRecon_Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item A formal definition of 3D reconstruction and extend this definition into the applied domain.
\item representation of the inputs and outpus
\item visual and geometric properties used by various techniques
\end{itemize}

\section{Definition}
Give a formal and applied definition of 3D reconstruction

\section{Representation}
\begin{itemize}
\item inputs: image types
\item outputs: representations of 3D models
\end{itemize}

\section{Description}
visual and geometric properties considered
\begin{itemize}
\item texture coverage
\item albedo
\item specularity
\item sub-surface scattering
\item translucency
\item metalness
\item roughness
\item concavity
\item depth-discontinuity
\end{itemize}

\section{Expression}
provide a means of specifying both the desired representation of the problem, as well as the conditions under which the reconstruction is occuring.
