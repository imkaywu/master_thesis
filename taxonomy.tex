\chapter{A new taxonomy of 3D Reconstruction}
\label{ch:3DRecon_Tax}

The taxonomy proposed in this chapter defines the 3D reconstruction space based on the visual cues that 3D reconstruction techniques utilizes. This taxonomy transforms the 3D reconstruction problem from one requiring knowledge and expertise of specific algorithms in terms of how and when to use them, to one requiring knowledge of the visual and geometric properties of the target object.
