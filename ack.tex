\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I want to thank my supervisor, Professor Sidney Fels, for offering me this opportunity to pursue this research direction, and provide invaluable guidance in the supervision of this thesis. I'm also deeply indebt to Dr. Gregor Miller for his mentorship and constant words of encouragement to keep me sane.

I want to thank my labmates for making it such a delight to come to work everyday. I'm thankful for all the white board discussion, coding and experimenting, and late night grinding before deadlines. Those are the memories I will cherish for the rest of my life.

Last but not least, thanks to my family for their unconditional support, especially in times of stress.
