\section{Summary}

\section{Future directions}

\subsection{Geometric Model}
Current geometric model fails to capture the complexity of the real world object and focues mainly on the visual properties. Thus one of the future directions is to develop intuitive geometric models to describe complex object.

\subsection{Property Parameters}
We use a try-and-see approach to obtain the property settings of the object, which is base on judgements of the users, thus not very rigorous and seems cumbersome. We can use machine learning techniques to obtain the visual and geometric information

\subsection{Metric}
We utilized three metrics: accuracy, completeness and angular error. However, there are some other measures that worth investigating: colour accuracy, `ghost' reconstruction error, etc. Additional metrics can extend the application of the framework and provide more option for developers to choose from.

\subsection{Mapping Construction}
The construction of mapping requires evaluation of the algorithm for pairwise properties, which doesn't scale so well with respect to the number of properties. Therefore, we need a more 

\subsection{Interpreter}
Current implementation of interpreter is a simplistic one and doesn't fully take advantage of all the information we have obtained from the construction of mapping. Therefore, we should develop a more sophisticated interpreter
