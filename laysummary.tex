\chapter{Lay Summary}

3D modeling of the real world has a wide range of applications, including 3D mapping and navigation, content creation for virtual reality, online shopping, video games, visual effects, cultural heritage archival, and so on. However, existing approaches requires vision background to full take advantage of these algorithms. The thesis is dedicated to develop a description-based interface to 3D reconstruction problem. The interface hides the details of algorithms by using a description of visual and geometric properties of the object. This description can be interpreted to one appropriate algorithm, which can give a successful reconstruction result. This allows the application developers to deploy 3D reconstruction functionalities in their domain-specific applications without the need to understand the algorithm details.
