\chapter{Lay Summary}

3D modelling of the real world has a wide range of applications, including 3D mapping and navigation, content creation for virtual reality, online shopping, video games, visual effects, cultural heritage archival, and so on. However, existing approaches requires vision background to fully take advantage of these algorithms. This thesis is dedicated to developing a description-based interface for 3D reconstruction problems. The interface hides the details of algorithms via a description layer, which describes visual and geometric properties of an object. This description can be interpreted into one appropriate algorithm, which leads to a successful reconstruction result. This allows the application developers to deploy 3D reconstruction functionality in their domain-specific applications without the need to understand the algorithm details.
